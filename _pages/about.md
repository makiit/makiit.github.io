Hi, My name is Mohammad Ali Khan, I am a second year masters student at the University of California San Diego. As you might have seen from the cheesy title of this website, I am interested in interpretable, robust and fair artificial intelligence. My current research is focused on designing a latent embedding space, which would serve as a semantic representation of a deep learning model and using it to give feedback while training. I am advised on this project by Prof Lily Weng (https://lilyweng.github.io/). I intend to use this website to give interested people some idea about what I am working on and to document my writings on this field.

Further I would also like to use this to document some projects that I worked on that are close to my heart. Please reach out to me if you would like to know more about me, my projects or talk about explainable AI in general.
